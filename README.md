## drunk classifications 
    * sober: everything off
    * buzzed: slightly noticible
        - keys: slight type-o's (so slight the user might think it's their type-o)
        - buttons: very slight motion.. noticible but very much usuable (buttons should stay within their region desite number of hovers)
        - lean: no lean
        - focus: no focus
    * I'm fine: definitely noticiable but not annoying 
        - keys: noticible type-o's (user should now noticed but still not really be annoyed by them)
        - buttons: noticible motion.. still usable but close to annoying
        - lean: very slight intermittent lean.. kinda like small flashes of rolls
        - focus: very slight intermittent blurring in and out.. not enough to prevent reading and slight enough that most may not notice
    * drunk: annoying but useful
        - keys: type-o's are now impossible to ignore and happen in seemingly every word
        - buttons: quite dynamic motion, should border on frustrating, perhaps random keys are more difficult to chase down than others
        - lean: lean should be in full effect, the page should sway back and forth constantly but not by too much
        - focus: focus now throbs in and out.  The max blur should still be fairly  readable
    * wooo!: holy shit I can barely use this webpage
        - keys: type-o's should happen with every word, in fact a fair number of words should have more than one injected type-o
        - buttons: buttons should now be close to impossible to click.. perhaps some random buttons are easier to click
        - lean: the sway should be constant and quite large.. the user should be getting sea sick at this point
        - focus: focus should throb in and out, with the max blur being impossible to read
    * blackout drunk: completely unusable (black sceen? no.... hmm)
