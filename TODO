TODO's and shit, so's I can get started again:
--------------------------------------------
- build drink menu
    - have gear icon for settings/advanced
    - have menu icon for drink menu
    - put like.. a few drinks in there

- investigate click/drag outside of box for chrome plugin (maybe just have 'browser' box for now)

- source of truth for drink consumptio logic

- refactor demo code and boozybrowser.js logic to be more modular/play nice with advanced(manual) vs regular mode

- ingredient strengths:
    (3) tough booze (bacardi 151 etc)
    (2) hard booze (vodka etc)
    (1) booze (beer, wine)
    (0) not booze (juice etc)
    (-1) negative booze (coffee etc)

- drink consumption logic
    sober: 0 (obvi)
    buzzed: 1
    im-fine: 4
    drunk: 7
    wooo: 10
    blackout: 13+

- detemine if I wanna add logic for waiting to get drunk/sobering up
    - while I'm at it, see if there's an easy way to set datetimes for peeps to schedule

- see if there's a way to remove the jQuery dependence from boozybrowser.js

- spend some serious time nerding out on CSS animations and see if I can't make that shit super amazing... think like... wobbling paper amazing

- fix readme when this shit's alll over

========================================
thoughts on architecture:
~ currently everything is being handled in boozybrowser.js, thinking of breaking this up, but not sure how yet. ~

- boozybrowser.js
    * sets booziness of browser, has tiers set for boozy levels
    * sets type of booziness, focus, keys etc
    * sets what gets boozy, body, buttons etc
    ----------
    * handles drink input and enforces setting of boozy levels
    * handles setting interval for getting drunk/sobering up the "natural" way
    * handles setting preset drunk levels on your browser via scheduling/time of day
