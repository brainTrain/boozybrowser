TODO's and shit, so's I can get started again:
---------------------------------------------

- determine if I wanna add logic for different amounts of booze/ingredients in drinks (essentially add ingredients and prolly have a bunch of designations: 
    (4) super hard (bacardi 151 etc), 
    (3) hard (vodka etc), 
    (2) almost hard(triple sec etc), 
    (1) semi hard (beer, wine), 
    (0) not hard (juice etc), 
    (-1) negative hard (coffee etc)

- work on better names for all that hard shit ^

- detemine if I wanna add logic for waiting to get drunk/sobering up
    - while I'm at it, see if there's an easy way to set datetimes for peeps to schedule

- see if there's a way to remove the jQuery dependence from boozybrowser.js

- spend some serious time nerding out on CSS animations and see if I can't make that shit super amazing... think like... wobbling paper amazing

- fix readme when this shit's alll over
